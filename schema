Phase
———
id: objId
name: Phase 1 - Begin Data Collection
runId: 1
groups: //obj ids of the groups used in this Phase, everyone is in the Public group

I'm thinking we want to know when kids change groups (for data analysis later on), so i was thinking of an ‘association’.

User
———
id: objId
name: “Alessandro”
group_associations: // ids of the group association objs
runId: //what run is this user associated with


Group
— — —
id: objId
name: “Red Group”
time_created: timestamp


GroupAssociation
— — —
id: objId
groupId: //objectId of the group
userId: //objId of user
time_entered: //the timestamp when they join the group
time_exited: //the timestamp when they join the group
